Back in 2010, I studied abroad in Adelaide, Australia while in university. It's
a medium sized city and Australia's fifth largest. The link to find the export

I'm from Chicago and originally I decided to study in Adelaide because of it's
low key, middle class standing for the country (much like what Chicago stands
for in the United States, in my eyes). Being not as popular as a destination as
Sydney or Melbourne, Adelaide is still a beautiful city stuck right in the middle
of the country. The Barossa Valley, a world renowned area for wine making, is
located north of the city in the country. South of Adelaide is Kangaroo Island
(filled with only some kangaroos) and Tasmania (my favorite place I visited
while abroad). Overall, I had an amazing experience when I was there, and look
forward to revisiting the areas in this project to learn about it in ways I
never knew.
