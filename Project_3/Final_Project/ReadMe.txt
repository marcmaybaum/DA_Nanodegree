ReadMe File for Udacity Project 3

Adelaide.txt is a text file that describes where I captured the XML file and why I chose this location.

adelaide_australia_sample.osm is the target file for data_10_15.py script.
adelaide_australia_sample.osm holds sampled data from the Adeliade, Australia OpenStreetMap Data. 

Audit.py file was used for the Case Study project to further understand the dataset

Data_10_15.py holds all of the cleaning and structuring functions and writes the osm file into five separate CSVs. The last get_shape() function was adapted from the Lesson 3 Case Study project.

CSV_to_DB.py is the script that reads each CSV output file from Data_10_15.py and writes it into a database.

Querying_DB.html is my exploration of the dataset, issues found in the data, and insights surrounding Adelaide.

References.txt is a file that cites every source I used throughout the process of creating this project.
